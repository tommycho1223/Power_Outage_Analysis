## Introduction

Power outages can really shake things up, affecting daily life, business operations, and essential services. Figuring out what causes these outages, their patterns, and how long they last is crucial. This knowledge helps improve power grid reliability, reduces downtime, and better supports the communities impacted.

In this project, we're diving into power outage data to uncover valuable insights and predict how long outages might last and what factors influence them.

Weâ€™ve broken the project into several key steps, each focusing on a different part of the dataset to deepen our understanding and sharpen our models:
